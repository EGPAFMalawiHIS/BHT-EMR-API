# Code Documentation
## Summary
The documentation is for a module called ```CommonSqlQueryUtils``` that provides two methods: ```occupation_filter``` and ```external_client_query```. The ```occupation_filter``` method takes in parameters such as occupation, field_name, table_name, and include_clause, and returns a SQL clause based on the occupation value. The ```external_client_query``` method takes in the end_date parameter and returns a SQL query that retrieves person_ids from the ```obs``` table based on certain conditions.

Example Usage
### Example usage of the ```occupation_filter``` method
```ruby
include CommonSqlQueryUtils


occupation_filter(occupation: 'Military', field_name: 'occupation', table_name: 'users', include_clause: true)
```
#### Output: "WHERE users.occupation = 'Military'"

```ruby
occupation_filter(occupation: 'Civilian', field_name: 'occupation', table_name: 'users', include_clause: false)
```
#### Output: "users.occupation != 'Military'"

### Example usage of the ```external_client_query``` method
```ruby
include CommonSqlQueryUtils

external_client_query(end_date: '2021-01-01')
```
#### Output: SQL query string

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- ```occupation``` (string): The occupation value to filter on.
- ```field_name``` (string): The name of the field to filter on.
- ```table_name``` (string): The name of the table to include in the SQL clause.
- ```include_clause``` (boolean): Whether to include the ```WHERE``` clause in the SQL statement.
- ```end_date``` (string): The end date to use in the SQL query.

### Flow
The ```occupation_filter``` method checks if the ```include_clause``` parameter is true and sets the ```clause``` variable to ```WHERE``` if it is.
The ```table_name``` variable is modified to include a trailing dot if it is not blank.
The method then checks if the ```occupation``` parameter is blank or equal to ```All``` and returns an empty string in those cases.
If the ```occupation``` parameter is ```Military```, the method returns a SQL clause string with the ```occupation``` field equal to ```Military```.
If the ```occupation``` parameter is ```Civilian```, the method returns a SQL clause string with the ```occupation``` field not equal to ```Military```.



The ``external_client_query`` method quotes the ```end_date``` parameter using ActiveRecord::Base.connection.quote.
The method then returns a multi-line SQL query string that retrieves person_ids from the ```obs``` table based on certain conditions.


### Outputs
The ``occupation_filter`` method returns a SQL clause string based on the occupation value.


The ``external_client_query`` method returns a multi-line SQL query string.
