## Encounter Statistics Report

The encounter statistics report is a hash that contains the following keys:

- `:total` - The total number of encounters for the given program, date, and user.
- `:me` - The number of encounters for the given program, date, and user where the user was the provider.
- `:facility` - The number of encounters for the given program, date, and user where the user was not the provider.

The encounter statistics report is generated by calling the `find_report` method on an instance of the `DashboardStats` class.
